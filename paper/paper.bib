	abstract = {We present OptaDOS, a program for calculating core-electron and low-loss electron energy loss spectra (EELS) and optical spectra along with total-, projected- and joint-density of electronic states (DOS) from single-particle eigenenergies and dipole transition coefficients. Energy-loss spectroscopy is an important tool for probing bonding within a material. Interpreting these spectra can be aided by first principles calculations. The spectra are generated from the eigenenergies through integration over the Brillouin zone. An important feature of this code is that this integration is performed using a choice of adaptive or linear extrapolation broadening methods which we show produces higher accuracy spectra than standard fixed-width Gaussian broadening. OptaDOS  may be straightforwardly interfaced to any electronic structure code. OptaDOS  is freely available under the GNU General Public licence from http://www.optados.org.

Program title:OptaDOS Catalogue identifier: AESK\_v1\_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AESK\_v1\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licencing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 110299 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1889705 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 95. Computer: Any architecture with a Fortran 95 compiler. Operating system: Linux, Mac OS X. Has the code been vectorised or parallelised?: Yes, using MPI RAM: 10 MB Word size: 32 or 64 Classification: 7.2, 7.3. External routines: MPI to run in parallel, CASTEP or any other electronic structure code capable of generating single-point eigenenergies and dipole transition coefficients. Nature of problem: Many properties of materials can be described using integration over the Brillouin zone such as core-level and low-loss EELS and optical spectra. This integration is performed computationally using a grid of k-points. The discrete energy eigenvalues must be interpolated into a continuous spectra. The most common method broadens the eigenvalues using a Gaussian function. Gaussian broadening suffers from slow convergence with number of k-points and a difficulty in resolving fine spectral features. Solution method: OptaDOS  improves the underlying Brillouin zone integration beyond fixed-width Gaussian broadening by using band gradients to perform adaptive and linearly extrapolated broadening. This increases the resolution of the predicted spectra. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Along with the usual band energies, band gradients are used to generate the linear extrapolation and adaptive broadening schemes producing a superior output able to represent both dispersive and localised bands concurrently. Additional comments: The input data to OptaDOS  are single-particle eigenenergies and dipole transition coefficients. OptaDOS  has an interface to obtain these from the CASTEP plane wave density-functional theory (DFT) code. The interfacing of OptaDOS  with other electronic structure codes, which are also capable of generating such inputs, is currently being undertaken Running time: A few seconds to ∼10 min.},

	abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N3atoms operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N2atoms scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. © 1996 The American Physical Society., This article appears in the following collection:},

To overcome this difficulty a new technique of flash photolysis and spectroscopy has been developed, using gas-filled flash discharge tubes of very high power. The properties of these lamps as spectroscopic and photochemical sources have been studied and details are given of their construction, spectra, duration of flash, and luminous efficiency in the photochemicaliy useful region. An apparatus is described which produces a very great photochemical change, in some cases over 80\%, in one-thousandth of a second and in a gas at several cm. pressure contained in an absorption tube 1 m. long, and which photographs the absorption spectrum at high resolution in one twenty-thousandth of a second at short intervals afterwards. Examples of the rapidly changing spectra of substances undergoing reaction, including the spectra of some of the intermediate radicals involved, are shown. These include the recombination of chlorine atoms, the absorption Spectra of S2 and CS obtained during the photochemical decomposition of carbon disulphide and new spectra attributed to the CIO and CH3CO radicals.},

Independent of phase, up to 100 lower levels of photocatalysis were found in dense films. Charge carrier lifetimes were probed by TAS on the microsecond to second time scale. For both rutile and anatase, recombination was independent of morphology. Rutile exhibited up to 10 times slower recombination kinetics than anatase. Efficient, irreversible hole scavenging by alcohols was present in mesoporous anatase alone, resulting in the generation of long-lived electrons (τ ≈ 0.7 s) which, upon the addition of the dye reduction target resazurin, enabled efficient electron transfer (τ ≈ 3 ms). Hole scavenging by alcohols on mesoporous rutile was substantially less efficient and more reversible than anatase, resulting in only a marginal increase in electron lifetime. The lower activity of rutile was not due to differences in recombination but rather to the deficiency of rutile holes to drive efficient and irreversible alcohol oxidation.},

	abstract = {A unified model for the direct gap absorption coefficient (band-edge and sub-bandgap) is developed that encompasses the functional forms of the Urbach, Thomas-Fermi, screened Thomas-Fermi, and Franz-Keldysh models of sub-bandgap absorption as specific cases. We combine this model of absorption with an occupation-corrected non-equilibrium Planck law for the spontaneous emission of photons to yield a model of photoluminescence (PL) with broad applicability to band-band photoluminescence from intrinsic, heavily doped, and strongly compensated semiconductors. The utility of the model is that it is amenable to full-spectrum fitting of absolute intensity PL data and yields: (1) the quasi-Fermi level splitting, (2) the local lattice temperature, (3) the direct bandgap, (4) the functional form of the sub-bandgap absorption, and (5) the energy broadening parameter (Urbach energy, magnitude of potential fluctuations, etc.). The accuracy of the model is demonstrated by fitting the room temperature PL spectrum of GaAs. It is then applied to Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) to reveal the nature of their tail states. For GaAs, the model fit is excellent, and fitted parameters match literature values for the bandgap (1.42 eV), functional form of the sub-bandgap states (purely Urbach in nature), and energy broadening parameter (Urbach energy of 9.4 meV). For CIGSSe and CZTSSe, the model fits yield quasi-Fermi leveling splittings that match well with the open circuit voltages measured on devices made from the same materials and bandgaps that match well with those extracted from EQE measurements on the devices. The power of the exponential decay of the absorption coefficient into the bandgap is found to be in the range of 1.2 to 1.6, suggesting that tunneling in the presence of local electrostatic potential fluctuations is a dominant factor contributing to the sub-bandgap absorption by either purely electrostatic (screened Thomas-Fermi) or a photon-assisted tunneling mechanism (Franz-Keldysh). A Gaussian distribution of bandgaps (local Eg fluctuation) is found to be inconsistent with the data. The sub-bandgap absorption of the CZTSSe absorber is found to be larger than that for CIGSSe for materials that yield roughly equivalent photovoltaic devices (8\% efficient). Further, it is shown that fitting only portions of the PL spectrum (e.g., low energy for energy broadening parameter and high energy for quasi-Fermi level splitting) may lead to significant errors for materials with substantial sub-bandgap absorption and emission.},

	abstract = {A theoretical framework for a general approach to reduce point defect density in materials via control of defect quasi Fermi level (dQFL) is presented. The control of dQFL is achieved via excess minority carrier generation. General guidelines for controlling dQFL that lead to a significant reduction in compensating point defects in any doped material is proposed. The framework introduces and incorporates the effects of various factors that control the efficacy of the defect reduction process such as defect level, defect formation energy, bandgap, and excess minority carrier density. Modified formation energy diagrams are proposed, which illustrate the effect of the quasi Fermi level control on the defect formation energies. These formation energy diagrams provide powerful tools to determine the feasibility and requirements to produce the desired reduction in specified point defects. An experimental study of the effect of excess minority carriers on point defect incorporation in GaN and AlGaN shows an excellent quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions. Illumination at energies larger than the bandgap is employed as a means to generate excess minority carriers. The case studies with CN in Si doped GaN, H and VN in Mg doped GaN and VM-2ON in Si doped Al0.65Ga0.35N revealed a significant reduction in impurities in agreement with the proposed theory. Since compensating point defects control the material performance (this is particularly challenging in wide and ultra wide bandgap materials), dQFL control is a highly promising technique with wide scope and may be utilized to improve the properties of various materials systems and performance of devices based upon them.},

     abstract = {Anatase:rutile TiO2 junctions are often shown to be more photocatalytically active than anatase or rutile alone, but   the underlying cause of this improvement is not fully understood. Herein, we employ transient absorption spectroscopy to study hole    transfer across the anatase:rutile heterojunction in films as a function of phase composition. By exploiting the different signatures  in the photoinduced absorption of trapped charges in anatase and rutile, we were able to separately track the yield and lifetime of    holes in anatase and rutile sites within phase composites. Photogenerated holes transfer from rutile to anatase on submicrosecond      time scales. This hole transfer can significantly increase the anatase hole yield, with a 20:80 anatase:rutile composite showing a 5-  fold increase in anatase holes observed from the microsecond. Hole transfer does not result in an increase in charge-carrier           lifetime, where an intermediate recombination dynamic between that of pure anatase (t1/2 ≈ 0.5 ms) and rutile (t1/2 ≈ 20 ms) is found  in the anatase:rutile junction (t1/2 ≈ 4 ms). Irrespective of what the formal band energy alignment may be, we demonstrate the         importance of trap-state energetics for determining the direction of photogenerated charge separation across heterojunctions and how   transient absorption spectroscopy, a method that can specifically track the migration of trapped charges, is a useful tool for         understanding this behavior.},
